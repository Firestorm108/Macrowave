<h1>Summary</h1>
The MacroWave is an annealing machine that evenly heats up 3D printed parts and cools them down to strenghten them! Similar to a microwave, it emits macro wavelengths of light (even though microwaves emit LONGER waves than the macrowave- isn't that funny?).

Today I made a BOM with an overall thought process of the design of the machine. It's got features like an easy to use touch screen, 4 bulbs, a heating pad, PWM control, sensors, and a rotating bed!
