<h1>Summary</h1>
The MacroWave is an annealing machine that evenly heats up 3D printed parts and cools them down to strenghten them! Similar to a microwave, it emits macro wavelengths of light (even though microwaves emit LONGER waves than the macrowave- isn't that funny?).

<h1>July 4th</h1>
Today I made a BOM with an overall thought process of the design of the machine. It's got features like an easy to use touch screen, 4 bulbs, a heating pad, PWM control, sensors, and a rotating bed!

Total Time Spent: 3 Hours

<h1>July 5th</h1>
After some changes to the design and BOM-optimizing (like switching 4 bulbs into 2 higher wattage bulbs), I began work on the PCB. I ended up finishing the entire PCB and squeezed it into less than 100mmx100mm so it should be able to fit in the budget. The PCB is just for the main control area and linking up all the components since a lot of the components aren't supposed to be mounted to the PCB.
