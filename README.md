A smart annealing system for 3D printed functional parts! It utilizes heating features such as a heated aluminum bed and infared heating lights that allow it to get up to 100C, perfect for PLA and PETG! My 3D printed parts
aren't always strong enough for my use cases, and I didn't want to ruin my oven by sticking my parts in there. So, I designed a cool looking annealing system that would do it better! Annealing is very effective, it can do crazy things like increase the heat resistance of PLA to 100C. 

<h1>What is annealing?</h1>

Annealing is the process of heating something in a controlled way and cooling it in a controlled way in order to relieve stress and increase properties of the object. It's used with all kinds of materials, from metals to plastics and more!
